# Teams Status Preserver

A lightweight browser-based tool that keeps your Microsoft Teams status active when you're away from your computer.

## How It Works

The app simulates user activity (mouse movements, clicks, keystrokes, scrolling) at random intervals to prevent Teams from changing your status to "Away" during periods of inactivity.

## Key Features

- Configurable event types (mouse, keyboard, scroll)
- Adjustable timing (5-60 seconds between events)
- Activity log to track simulated events
- Works offline and saves preferences locally
